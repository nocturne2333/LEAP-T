# LEAP-T
A lexicon-based approach to emotion analysis of tweets over a selected date range. 


__LEAP-T__ (*L*exicon-based *E*motion *A*nalysis *P*rogram - *T*witter) uses the 2016 National Research Council Canada's Emotion lexicon to crawl through tweets through a given date range and outputs an emotion analysis. Users simply edit lines 9-11 for the hashtag/phrase/word they want to search for and the date range. This is a modified version of an existing project.

This provides a printed (text) output that you can export into whatever data visualization program of your choice.
