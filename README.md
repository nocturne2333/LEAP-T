# LEAP-T
A lexicon-based approach to emotion analysis of tweets over a selected date range. 


LEAP-T (Lexicon-based Emotion Analysis Program - Twitter) uses the 2016 National Research Council Canada's Emotion lexicon to crawl through tweets through a given date range. Users simply edit lines 9-11 for the hashtag/phrase/word they want to search for and the date range. 

This provides a printed (text) output that you can export into whatever data visualization program of your choice.
